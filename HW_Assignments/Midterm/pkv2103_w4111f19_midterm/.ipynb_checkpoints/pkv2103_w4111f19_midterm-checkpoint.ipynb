    "**Cartesian Product:**  \n",
    "It is also referred to as Cross-Join, and returns all the rows from the tables listed in the query. Let's say if we have two tables, Table1 and Table2, each row in the first table is paired with all the rows in the second table. This happens when there is no relationship defined between the two tables. Consider Table1 with 10 rows and Table2 with 20 rows, the cartesian product will return 200 (10 * 20) rows.
